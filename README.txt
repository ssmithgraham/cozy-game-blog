Sophie Smithgraham Project 02

My project is a recommendation blog site for video games that evoke a
sense of relaxation, warmth, and comfort (AKA "Cozy Games").

The home page contains a list of games that I feel fall under this
category, and each game listed includes a link to another page that
goes into further detail about the game. It also includes a form at
the bottom that allows for suggestions of what games could be added to 
the list.

The individual pages give some factual information about the game, 
describes the content in the game (gameplay and features), and then 
includes my personal opinion on how it fits into the category of
"cozy game". I also describe the elements of the game that might not
fit the preferences of certain players.

The info page presents the price, platform, and multiplayer potential 
through a table.

I incorporated javascript into the project by making the images used throughout
the website interactive. The icons by the header on the main page can be 
changed by mousing over them, and the images used for the list of game 
recommendations get larger when moused over. The navigation bar at the top
highlights the text the mouse is hovering over on every page. For the 
individual game pages, I added a button using canvas elements.
When the button is clicked on, it cycles through several different images 
related to the specific game. On the info page, I added an FAQ section with 
question boxes that can be clicked on to reveal the answer as an alert.
